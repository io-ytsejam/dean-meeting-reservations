# dean-meetings-reservations
It is a simple service for deans working in university and their students. With DMR students can create request appointments with deans for a given date. If the requested date doesnâ€™t fit the dean, it can be negotiated from the dean's dashboard and accepted/rejected directly from email on the student side.
